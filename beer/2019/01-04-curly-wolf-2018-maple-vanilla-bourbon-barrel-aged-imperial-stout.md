### About Curly Wolf

> Creamy and complex, this American Imperial Stout is aged in bourbon barrels until it discovers its inner wolf. Fresh maple syrup is added to the boil and whole vanilla beans to each barrel to create unique flavors and sought after complexity. This beer is dangerously smooth and incredibly delicious.
