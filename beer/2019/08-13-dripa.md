### About DRIPA

> Double Rice India Pale Ale. This gold colored West Coast style Double India Pale Ale has an intense hop nose, with aromas mainly of citrus. The high hop character dominates this IPA’s flavor profile. Made with American long grain rice, it is quite difficult to make but the rice contributes to this beer’s crisp aftertaste.
