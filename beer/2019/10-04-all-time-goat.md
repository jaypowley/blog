### About ALL-TIME G.O.A.T.

> Our latest NE-style Double IPA is ON FIRE!!! Comprised of Galaxy, Nelson, Citra and Simcoe, All Time G.O.A.T. is worthy of all the awards. At 9.0% this juicy Power Forward euro-steps across your palate with notes of papaya, mango and orange creamsicle. Chamberlain, Jordan, Kobe, Lebron and even the great Scalabrine couldn't have guarded this future Hall of Famer.
> BOOM SHAKA LAKA!
