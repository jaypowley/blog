### About Death of the Sun

> Death of the Sun came the day the world went black. A beast of an Imperial Stout aged for over a year in the cosmic dark of Heaven Hill Bourbon Barrels. Notes of layered malt, dark fruit, and chocolate tame its heat. A beer so good you will rejoice in its perpetual darkness.
