### About Hangar 24 Craft Brewing

> Hangar 24 Craft Brewing began with a true passion for good beer, the absolute love of flying and the pure enjoyment of being around great friends. Founder and Master Brewer Ben Cook and his buddies used to meet at hangar 24 after an afternoon of flying to trade stories, talk aviation, play music and share a few cold ones that Ben just finished brewing at home. These days, the location of where these fine beers are brewed has changed, but the quality time spent enjoying a delicious, handcrafted beer and conversation with friends is the same as ever. Hangar 24 is located in Redlands, CA across the street from the Redlands Municipal Airport. Cheers.
