### About Dankwood (2018)

> What do you get when a big, bold imperial red IPA meets an oak bourbon barrel? A palate stunner that'll send your senses spinning or, as we like to call it, Dankwood. Rich caramel notes emerge from the depths of the IPA, highlighting strong malt character while the bourbon barrel-aging develops the complexity. A dank, sticky and slightly sweet sipper, Dankwood is the perfect alchemy of wood and hops. You may remember this beer as barrel-aged reDANKulous, which was featured heavily in our taproom (and many of our bellies). 12.2% ABV. 65 IBUs. Dankwood is the third release of 2018 in the Barrel-Aged Series.
