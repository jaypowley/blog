### About Samuel Adams Summer Ale

> Samuel Adams Summer Ale is an American wheat ale. This hazy golden unfiltered brew combines crisp wheat with the bright citrus of lemon peel and the subtle spice of Grains of Paradise. This rare African pepper, closely related to cardamom, was first used as a brewing spice in the 13th Century and adds just the right peppery kick. All of these flavors come together to create a thirst quenching and utterly refreshing brew perfect for those warm summer days.
