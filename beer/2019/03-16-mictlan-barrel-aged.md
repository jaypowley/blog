### About Mictlan: Barrel-aged

> Named after the Aztec Underworld, this Champurrado inspired beer was made for celebrating like an Aztec god. Spices and Cocoa Nibs accentuate the bourbon barrel aging while taming the beer bite, perfect for enduring the eternal fires of the underworld or sharing with friends.
