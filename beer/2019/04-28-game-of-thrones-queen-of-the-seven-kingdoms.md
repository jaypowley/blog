### About Game of Thrones: Queen of the Seven Kingdoms

> "Cersei is a complex character, and we’ve tried to emulate that profile with this beer, which blends a lovely, dry blonde ale with a subtly tart Belgian sour," says brewery president Doug Campbell.
>
> "When we set out to create the Royal Reserve Collection, we knew we had to pay homage the character currently sitting on the Iron Throne. We’re very happy to present this tribute to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms herself, Cersei Lannister" said Jeff Peters, Vice President of Global Licensing and Retail, HBO.
>
> Queen of the Seven Kingdoms pours a pale gold color with a brilliant white head. Aromas of melon, citrus, and lactic acidity meld together with fruity esters from the Belgian yeast. Tart citrus flavors soften to sweet malt flavors with notes of apricots. The finish is dry and crisp with a subtle citrus bite from the lemon peel. Queen of the Seven Kingdoms pairs well with sharp aged cheeses and salty cured meats, red meat or dark poultry, and spiced desserts like pumpkin pie or apple tarts.
