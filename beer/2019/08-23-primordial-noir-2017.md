### About Primordial Noir (2017)

> Primordial Noir is a blend of imperial red ales aged in bourbon and wine barrels for up to two years with Northwest-grown Bing cherries and spices. A concentrated precursor to our Sang Noir project, Primordial Noir features a more robust bourbon and cherry presence with notes of roast malt, molasses and baking spices.
