Itâ€™s the mother of Matryoshka, the stout to start all Matryoshka stouts. Wrap yourself in this rich Russian Imperial embrace, from Fort George to you, From Astoria With Love.
>
> From Astoria With Love will be available in the seasonal 16-ounce can lineup starting in February 2018. Look for four-packs and draft around the Pacific Northwest.
>
> The barrel aged version, Matryoshka, is typically released in late December or early January, with layers of variations following soon after.
