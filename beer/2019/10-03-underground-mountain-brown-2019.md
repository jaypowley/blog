### About Underground Mountain Brown (2019)

> Underground Mountain Brown is the harmonious drinking experience only achieved when our imperial brown ale, earthy sumatra coffee and a year aging in caves below Grand Rapids comes together. A team of malts complement the bold sumatra coffee perfectly, while time spent immersed in oak creates layers of depth and complexity. A celebration of the barrel, the bean and everything in between.
