### About Torito Rye Barrel with Cherries

> Torito is our Wild Baltic Porter brewed with German and English malts and fermented in stainless steel with German Lager yeast. After lagering in stainless steel we transfer Torito into barrels to mingle with our mixed culture. Nearly black in color with deep red highlights around the edge of the glass, this beer has clean lager notes up front that yield to flavors of dark chocolate with a vinous, port like quality. Our mixed culture contributes notes of dark fruit including plums, raisins, and cherries with restrained acidity.
>
> This version of Torito was refermented with loads of organic Montmorency cherries and aged in Rye Whiskey Barrels, to add additional complexity.
