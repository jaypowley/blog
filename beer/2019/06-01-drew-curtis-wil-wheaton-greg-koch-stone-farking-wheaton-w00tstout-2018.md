### About Drew Curtis / Wil Wheaton / Greg Koch Stone Farking Wheaton W00tstout (2018)

> Front and center this year is the result of Wil’s creative machinations taking the art direction duties with world-renowned fantasy artist Joe Jusko representing our gargoyle’s triumph over the evils in the world of beer. Six years into this amazing w00tstout legacy and I continue to be stunned and humbled by the response of our fans. Sure, it’s an amazingly delicious massive Russian Imperial Stout partially inspired by Kentucky Derby Pie of Drew’s home state. And speaking of Drew, we asked him to lean into two of his strengths: drinking w00tstout and chatting up a storm. So this year he’ll MC our wildly nerd-nominious celebration of beer and geekery known as HopCon/w00tstout release party held annually during San Diego’s Comic-Con. The nerd lives in all of us. Celebrate it! Now is the golden age for us lovers of awesome things. We’re here. We’re vast, and we’ve got great taste. This beer is an ode to you, Fellow Nerd.
