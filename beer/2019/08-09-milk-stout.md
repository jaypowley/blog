### About Milk Stout

> Brewed in Lancaster since 1994, we’re proud to present America’s original craft Milk Stout. Notes of milk chocolate, coffee and roasted malt goodness play counterpoint to a mild sweetness from the addition of milk sugar… You can’t go wrong with award winning Lancaster Milk Stout.
