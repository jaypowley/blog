### About Down With the PastryArchy (Cinnamon Roll Stout)

> We love stouts and couldn't resist adding stout variants to our Down with the Pastryarchy series. This fun spin takes you straight to the cafe for a mocha and cinnamon roll pairing with a blend of blend of roasty bready malts evoking coffee and dark chocolate with layers of cinnamon and vanilla in the background. Ultra smooth and drinkable at 7.5% abv.
>
> Collaboration with Momoâ€™s Donuts.
