### About Oak-Aged Vanilla World Wide Stout

> Brewed with a ridiculous amount of barley, we've now taken this Dogfish Head classic and aged it on oak with real vanilla beans! With a little tender love and care we foster this beer from smooth, sweet wort into the big, bad blackend stout it always longed to be. Its bold, port-like complexity goes great with (or as) dessert.
