### About Belgian Christmas Ale

> In Belgium, Old St. Nick delivers a bundle of sticks to those who have behaved badly throughout the year. Just to be safe, we suggest foregoing cookies and leaving Santa a pFriem Belgian Christmas Ale. Brewed with coriander in a rich, Dubbel base, its toffee aromas and hints of fresh, ripe orange will leave a milk-chocolaty velvet coat on Santa’s tongue and guarantee that you won’t be getting sticks this year.
