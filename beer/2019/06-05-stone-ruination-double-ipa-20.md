### About Stone Ruination Double IPA 2.0

> Stone Ruination IPA was the first full-time brewed and bottled West Coast double IPA on the planet. As craft beer has evolved over the years, so too have techniques for maximizing hop flavors and aromas. For the second incarnation of our groundbreaking India pale ale, we employ dry hopping and hop bursting to squeeze every last drop of piney, citrusy, tropical essence from the hops that give this beer its incredible character. We’ve also updated the name to Stone Ruination Double IPA 2.0 to reflect the imperial-level intensity that’s evident in every sip. Join us in cheering this, the second stanza in our 
"Liquid Poem to the Glory of the Hop."
