### About Bourbon County Brand Midnight Orange Stout (2018)

> We combined things we love, orange and chocolate, taking Bourbon County into a new and exciting direction. While the chocolate compliments the Bourbon County base, the orange zest offers a point of contrast for a bold new flavor profile to delight Bourbon County fans and newcomers alike. Recipe by Oscar Sanchez and Paul Lievens.
