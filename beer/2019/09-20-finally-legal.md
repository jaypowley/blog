### About Finally Legal

> Finally Legal is a big stout brewed with Munich malts, smoked malts, cocoa nibs, cocoa powder and vanilla. Rolling in at 13.5% ABV, Finally Legal has rich chocolate flavor with hints of vanilla and a touch of smoky bacon. As if thatâ€™s not enough, we blended this tasty brew with its bourbon barrel aged counterpart before packaging it for your enjoyment.
