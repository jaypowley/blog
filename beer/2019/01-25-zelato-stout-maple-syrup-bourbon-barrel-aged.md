## Zelato Stout Maple Syrup Bourbon Barrel Aged by Barrel House Z

I was not a fan of this beer. To me, it had a weird Splenda after taste to it. Others commented that it was "infected" whatever that is supposed to mean. You mileage may vary.

### About Zelato Stout Maple Syrup Bourbon Barrel Aged

> Expect woody notes, which are slightly fruity due to re-fermentation that occurs from the beer's interaction with residual maple syrup. Coffee roastiness is a strong, welcome addition as is the essential bitterness introduced by chocolate malt and dark roasted barley. A gentle touch of flaked barley gives a rich mouthfeel.
