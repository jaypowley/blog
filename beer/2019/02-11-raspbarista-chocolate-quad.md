### About RaspBarista Chocolate Quad

> RaspBarista by Kasteel is a blend of the original Barista Chocolate Quad and St. Louis Framboise. The tartness of the raspberries (framboise) contrasts with bitter-dark chocolate notes in the beer. It also tones down the coffee aroma a touch. RaspBarista Chocolate Quad has an 11% ABV, with a surprisingly lighter body than most traditional quads. This beer alone can be the perfect end to a feast, but its lighter body makes it the perfect beer to pair with most decadent desserts.
