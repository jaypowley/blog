### About Big Mother

> Big Mother has been our Anniversary Ale since inception so it is near and dear to our hearts. An ever changing recipe with each vintage, it's still everything you expect from a IIIPA: Big, but not too boozy, massively hopped, and just enough malt character to balance the higher alcohol and lingering bitterness. A whirlpool and dry hop assault lends aromas and flavors of apricot, naval oranges, red grapefruit, and papaya.
