## Alpha King by 3 Floyds Brewing Company

### About Alpha King

> A bold yet balanced American Pale Ale with slight caramel sweetness and aggressive citrus hoppiness. This is our flagship beer.

My buddy, [Ramsey][ramsey-url], and I both ordered this bottle. I got mine first and poured it/drank it while the waitress went to the other bar (inside vs patio) to get another bottle. Unfortunately, they were all out and I got the last one. Three Floyds is a favorite of his and I genuinely felt bad that I had stolen it from him. It was too late to share and be a good friend at that point.

Lesson learned - always offer your friend the beer first before assuming ownership. ðŸ˜¢
