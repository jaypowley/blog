### About Molotov Heavy

> Despite the crudeness it is tricky to make an effective Molotov cocktail. Despite the unruly nature of the rebel it is very tricky to resist accepted conventions. Molotov Heavy is a tour de force in rebellious hoppiness, itâ€™s a heavy spark for action and by far one of the most anti-authoritative beers ever made by Evil Twin Brewing.
