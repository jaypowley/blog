### About 420 Strain G13 IPA

> G13 IPA is a strange new strain, indeed. We took the dank hop profile you’d expect from a hazy IPA, and married it with terpenes and natural hemp flavors. The result is a big yet balanced IPA that mimics the aroma and taste of a heady, green G13. G13 IPA is a sticky super-hybrid that’s ready to rip.
>
> Pungent and dank aromatics on this terpene infused IPA fill the room once the beer is opened. We went with an aggressive dry hop schedule which interlaces nicely with the unique flavors to bring forward citrus and earthy notes followed by a resinous finish. This one’s fire!
>
> Columbus and Simcoe in the boil and dry hop!
