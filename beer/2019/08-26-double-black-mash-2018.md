### About Double Black Mash (2018)

> Take a good thing and make it even better – that’s the philosophy behind Double Black Mash. This huge Imperial Stout was easily big and potent enough after the first mashing, but we thought what the heck let’s give it another spin. So we mashed it in a second time doubling everything that was already good while aiming for great. All grain, heavy duty, no nonsense.
> Did we hit what we aimed at? Well, that’s really up to you to decide. If you like it big and black this is your kinda beer for sure.
