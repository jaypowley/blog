### About Donlon IIPA

> Once a year, over 13,000 beer professionals get together for the Craft Brewers Conference to talk beer, trade secrets, scope out new gear and well, do what beer professionals do best…drink beer. 
>
>This year the conference was held at the Music City Center in Nashville, Tennessee, a city steeped in creativity, southern hospitality, honky tonk and of course hot chicken. And not to mention they have a killer up-and-comping craft beer scene with some pretty amazing breweries.  But at the end of it all, after the long seminars and countless hours spent listening to Jonny Cash cover bands, the Craft Brewers Association hosts the World Beer Cup®, aka the "Olympics of Beer".
>
>The World Beer Cup® winners were selected by an international panel of 295 beer judges from 33 countries, with a field of 8,234 entries from 2,515 breweries in 66 countries. It's the largest craft beer competition to date!
>
>We're proud to announce, that MadeWest's very own Donlon IIPA took bronze in the Imperial India Pale Ale category for 2018! Hats off to our brew staff for winning this prestigious award. It's humbling to find a place among the many talented breweries in the World, many of whom we look up to! Grateful to be part of the craft brew scene and cheers to all the craft breweries working hard and making amazing beer. Cheers!
