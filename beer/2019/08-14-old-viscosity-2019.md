### About Old Viscosity (2019)

> In a pinch, this beer could be substituted for your jalopy's engine oil. While most haven't chugged used oil from the crank case, it wouldn't be black as a starry night, nor sport a creamy tan head like Old Viscosity. Remember, oil changes every 3k miles and drink Old Viscosity as needed. Everyone wins.
