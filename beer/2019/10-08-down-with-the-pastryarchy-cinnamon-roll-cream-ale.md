### About Down With the Pastryarchy (Cinnamon Roll Cream Ale)

> Cinnamon Rollinâ€™ on to the next in the series! At 903 we have strong women at the helm and we wanted to brew a series to celebrate the women that love craft and the strength they bring to the community. These brews are packed with flavor and should be a reminder of what the women of 903 Brewers and others in the industry bring to the craft industry.
