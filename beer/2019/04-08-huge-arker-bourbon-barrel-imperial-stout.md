### About Huge Arker Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout

> True to its Boontling moniker, "Huge Arker" is a massive force of nature that detonates on your tongue. After primary fermentation, the beer is aged in Wild TurkeyÂ® Bourbon barrels until it fully matures. The deep mahogany color is evocative of the opulence to follow. Dark luscious aromas of burnished oak mingle with candy sugar, bourbon and hearth-baked bread. The luxurious flavors redolent of honey and molasses are intertwined with the richness of dark chocolate and the ardent warmth of alcohol, underpinned with hints of coffee, vanilla and dark fruits.
