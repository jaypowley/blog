### About Beerthday Cake

> Its our anniversary! Two years of beer requires something different: Beerthday Cake is our take on the dichotomous white stout. It’s got soft pillows of vanilla, lactose and almonds, hints of spice from the coffee and cinnamon, and underlying white cake and frosting notes: it’s still a beer and a perfect one for a celebration. You don’t cut this cake, you crack it open.
