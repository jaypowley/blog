### About Braxton Labs Mint Chocolate Chip

> The first release in Braxton Labs 2019 Pastry Stout Series, this robust and chewy imperial stout is loaded with oats and dark malts to bring forward a huge mouthfeel and big notes of caramel, roast, and chocolate. After fermentation, we added liquid cocoa nibs and fresh mint leaves to recreate one our favorite classic ice cream flavors! Rich and delicate, this big stout leads with deep chocolate and finishes with a cooling mint exhalation.
