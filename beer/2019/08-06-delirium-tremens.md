### About Delirium Tremens

> NB: Depending on the location and batch, this beer can be either 8.5% or 8.7%. Please do not post an edit request asking to change it from one to the other.
> 
> The allusion to pink elephants and the choice of names is not due to chance. With a particular character, the unique taste of results from the use of three different kinds of yeast. The result is a finish of peppery bitterness without aggression. The gray bottle hides a mystery awaiting discovery by the none faint of heart.
