### About Serpent's Stout

> The history of the bible and religion is indeed the struggle of good vs. evil. Our Serpentâ€™s Stout recognizes the evil of the dark side that we all struggle with.
>
> This is a massively thick and opaque beer that begs the saints to join the sinners in their path to a black existence.
