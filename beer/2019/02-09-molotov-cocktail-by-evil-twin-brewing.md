### About Molotov Cocktail by Evil Twin Brewing

> Did you like Before During and after Christmas, maybe you thought it poured brilliantly, the alcohol was admirable well hidden and you loved how the arrogant amounts of hops numbed your mouth. This beer will knock your tongue off - it's a tour de force in hoppiness and by far one of the craziest beer ever made by Evil Twin Brewing.
