### About Frog's Hollow Double Pumpkin Ale

> There's a Place just south they call Frog's Hollow, with cauldrons afire in Fall, and they only speak in whispers of the name. There's a brewery they say who has the secret, of spices picked just right. With a crying shout, they'll knock it out, and hand you this Frog's delight.
