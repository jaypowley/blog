### About Santa's Little Helper (Bourbon Barrel Aged)

> Our Bourbon barrel-aged version of Santaâ€™s Little Helper, this Imperial Stout begins the journey with flavors of sweet Bourbon and oak, continues with hints of nutty dark chocolate and malt and finishes with a smoky coffee finish. A perfect beer to leave for the Jolly Old Fat Man instead of milk and cookies.
