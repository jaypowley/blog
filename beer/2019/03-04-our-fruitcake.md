### About Our Fruitcake

> Let's just say that a couple of us around the brewery are fruitcake fanatics! That being so, making a mixed-spirit barrel aged Old Ale was inevitable. We present to you Our Fruitcake: a strong red ale aged in a mix of Port, Brandy and Bourbon barrels (along with a couple neutral American oak barrels). This beer is as complex as its namesake but, we hope, much more approachable! It has tons of dark fruit and booze-soaked cake flavor with a touch of bright citrus acidity.
