### About Game of Thrones: King in the North

> King in the north - a beer for Jon - is an imperial stout aged for over six months in bourbon barrels. The beer is black as pitch, with aromas of bourbon and chocolate. A fitting companion for a long dark night. "King In The North" is our final expression of what a court brewer would offer a noble lord or lady: perfect balance and pure drinking pleasure.

King in the North pours jet black with a thick tan head. Aromas of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate blend with those of oak, bourbon, and vanilla. The flavor is rich and full with notes of chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and roasted malt up front followed by smooth bourbon and a hint of oak. The finish is thick and chewy with oatmeal creaminess, and pleasant lingering roast. King in the North pairs well with funky aged cheeses, rich dark meats and decadent desserts. It also makes a great dessert on its own.
