### About Pernicious IPA

> Formerly named East Side or Die IPA, Pernicious is our flagship India Pale Ale. With minimum malt complexity, we dry hop this beer with nearly twice the normal amount of hops typical to this style. The combination of juicy, tropical fruit-forward hops with heavy resinous American hops is the epitome of a West Coast IPA, made right here in the Southeast.
