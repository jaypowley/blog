### About Apis IV

> Apis IV pours a dark brown with hues of orange and red, a thick creamy of-white head, and traditional belgian lacing. The beer has notes of bread, dark plums, figs, molasses, and honey, balanced by light earthy and floral bitterness, with spice notes from the Belgian Yeast Strain we use in this beer brewed in the trappist dark belgian-style ale tradition.
