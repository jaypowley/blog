### About Short Term Goals

> Fully loaded with copious quantities of Mosaic, Amarillo, Simcoe & Azacca hops. Light haze, juicy tropical fruit aromas & flavors (heavy on pineapple & orange), and just enough Maris Otter malt base + piney bitterness for balance. A new year is coming: itâ€™s time for some SHORT TERM GOALS.
