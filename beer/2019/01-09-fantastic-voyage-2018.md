### About Fantastic Voyage (2018)

> The rebirth of Fantastic Voyage is a return to slow jams and silk sheets. We combine a smooth yet strong imperial milk stout base with a heap of dried coconut in the whirlpool. The result is a luscious blend of bakers chocolate, subtle roast, and sweet coconut. So take a sip and just sail on.
