### About All I See Is Carrion (Ghost 660)

> Cherry on the Nose, Bold, Rich, and Malty, Dark Sugar, Full Creamy Body.
>
>You scavenge the earth grasping at life's sweet indulgences. Never ending consumption drives your futile existence. A mindless march towards your own demise, wading through a sea of rotting flesh, no living creature unscathed. Decadence to be rewarded with the wrath of your own god. The gradual subjugation of your mind, body, and soul.
