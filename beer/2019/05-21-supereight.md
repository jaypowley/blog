### About SuperEIGHT

> SuperEIGHT is a sessionable super gose brewed with a bevy of heroic ingredients: prickly pear, mango, boysenberry, blackberry, raspberry, elderberry, kiwi juices, toasted quinoa and an ample addition of red Hawaiian sea salt! These unique ingredients give this beer a vibrant red color, with delicious flavors of berries and watermelon, along with a slightly tart - yet refreshing - finish.
