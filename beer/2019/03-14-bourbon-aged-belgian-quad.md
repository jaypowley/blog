### About Bourbon Aged Belgian Quad

> Our Quad is tasty, smooth, and brings the spirit after aging in Woodford Reserve Bourbon Barrels. Offered exclusively through Rooftop and Tavour.com, if you are lucky enough to score a bottle, feel free to cellar it for a special occasion or drink right away. Either way, you wont be disappointed.
