## 100 Percent (New England IPA) by River Bend Hop Farm and Brewery

### About River Bend Hop Farm and Brewery

> Situated among the hills outside of historic Newport, Pennsylvania, River Bend Hop Farm and Brewery is housed in a century-old barn located at the bend of the Juniata River. Settled in the midst of wildlife and our own hop fields, we offer a true farm-to-beer glass (or growler!) approach to the craft beer industry.
