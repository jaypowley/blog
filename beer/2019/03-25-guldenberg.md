### About Guldenberg

> Guldenberg is a high-fermenting, balanced bitter beer. The origin of the name comes from the former Guldenberg-abbey in Wevelgem where monks used to make beer. Also, Wevelgem is the birthplace of one of the brewers.
>
> Taste: A full-bodied abbey beer that balances between sweet and bitter. It is dry-hopped with Hallertau Mittelfr√ºh which results in a unique soft-bitter taste and aroma.
