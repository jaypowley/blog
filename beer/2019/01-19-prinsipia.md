### About Prinsipia

> Our take on the classic style. We use two row barley, beet sugar, date sugar, and a special yeast to create a wonderful array of flavors. Prinsipia brings light aromas of candied plums, brown sugar, biscuits, tobacco, and cherries. A soft mouthfeel leaves no trace of the 11.5% alcohol by volume. The name Prinsipia is inspired by Isaac Newtonâ€™s most famous work, "Principia," with a little more emphasis on the "sip."
