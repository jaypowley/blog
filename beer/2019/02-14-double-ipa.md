### About Double IPA

> Just like the name implies, brewing a batch of pFriem Double IPA takes twice the regular amount of malt and hops. That means each pint is brimming with doubly-rich aromas of fresh berries, notes of papaya and a malty sweetness. Just make sure to raise your glasses twice because a beer like this deserves a double cheers!
