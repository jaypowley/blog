### About Quad Sur Bois (Brewers Intent Spring 2019)

> Brewers Intent release for Spring 2019. Belgian style Quad ale, aged in Malbec barrels. 
> 
> Belgian Quad meets French Malbec, all made right here in Truckee, CA. This elegant beer greets you with hints of red currant, raisin, plum, and just a touch of vanilla. Wood tannins from the barrel are apparent, and it finishes with a slightly dry character and notes of soft oak and cherry.
