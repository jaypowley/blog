### About Voodoo Love Child

> Voodoo Love Child is our Gran Met aged on passion fruit, cherries, and raspberries. This is traditionaly unique to Lambics. So we feel, why should they get all the fun? This ale is inspired by fun, flavor, and a passion for brewing. We say, have a couple and your own Voodoo Love Child later. ABV 9.5%
