### About Dark Subject Matter

> Sit down. We've got to talk. The simplest way to describe Dark Subject Matter is an adjunct-free American Imperial stout. But that doesn't tell the whole story. With 2-row, Munich and chocolate malts in the mix, this beer is roasty and toasty like most stouts. Chocolate is prevalent on the nose, and this beer is silky smooth. Pair it with a hot fudge sundae, a fine cigar or your favorite true crime podcast.
