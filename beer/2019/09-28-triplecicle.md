### About Triplecicle

> Do you like IPA? Well, there are three IPA's in this baby! At 12% ABV, it’s like getting punched in the face by the Stay Puft man but balanced with hops that only taste like oranges and enough vanilla beans to open a TCBY. It's creamy but no lactose was used. (We wouldn't want to exclude anyone from this one-time offering.) Dry-hopped at 4.5 lbs per barrel and conditioned on vanilla beans, it’s full of the flavors of childhood summers. Enjoy this adult libation--no wooden spoon required.
