### About Smog City Brewing

> We are a family-run craft brewery focused entirely on creating and distributing exceptional beers. In 2013, we received final building and license approvals and began brewing in our own brewery. Our Taproom is now open. Stop in and see us for a taste of our proven and experimental beers and a tour of our brewery.
