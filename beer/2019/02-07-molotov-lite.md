### About Molotov Lite

> Back in the days, only uncomplicated and tasteless beers existed and people started feeling bored before happy hour was up. Molotov Lite is a understated tour de force in rebellious hoppiness, itâ€™s a subtle spark for action and yet by far one of the most anti-authoritative beers ever made by Evil Twin Brewing.
