### About Level 13

> This super-duper barrel-aged beer delivers bold fruity flavors with deep caramel notes and warming attributes. We aged this beer in a variety of oak bourbon barrels where the alcohol by volume slowly leveled up. Bright carbonation tickles your palate and leaves you with a crisp sherry-like finish. Notes of candy apple, warm sugar, and light spice. Pairs well with a fist full of quarters.
