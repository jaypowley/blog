### About Reindeer Tears (2018)

> There won’t be any reindeer games around Santa’s workshop this year. The jolly old man has gone rogue, collecting tears for this inaugural bourbon barrel-aged barley wine release. The deranged elves were hard at work throughout the summer months crafting this seasonal holiday ale for your enjoyment. Don’t bother trying to make the nice list. You’re sure to get coal in your stocking for this one.
