### About Upward & Onward

> Upward and Onward has everything you need for an extended voyage to the bottom of the bottle to the height of the stars. This Imperial Stout is super chocolatey, with notes of bourbon spice and vanilla from its 10-month mission in barrels. Sharing is caring, buy one for a comrade.
