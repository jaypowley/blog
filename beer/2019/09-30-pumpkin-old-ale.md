### About Dogfish Head Craft Brewery

The original plan to deliver great music, delicious food and fine beers to the community came to life when the first batch of Shelter Pale Ale beers were started. Soon, Dogfish Head engaged in brewing 12 gallons of beer batches to supply the restaurantâ€™s need. Dogfish Head brewery quickly achieved popularity beyond the state and reaches to nearby areas like Philadelphia and Washington D.C. By 2000, Dogfish Head is selling over 20 types of beers in 30 states
