### About Sam '76

> By experimenting with both lager and ale yeast strains, the brewers at Sam Adams came up with the concept for a brand new beer – Sam ’76. This truly unique brew takes two active fermentations and blends them together to create a deliciously harmonious result. This process delivers a distinct flavor that showcases the slight fruitiness of an ale with the balanced drinkability and smoothness of a lager. Sam ’76 will surprise any craft beer lover with its huge flavor and aroma along with a light-bodied, refreshing crispness. At just 4.7% ABV, this brew is perfect for those sessionable occasions. Cascade, Citra, Mosaic, Simcoe and Galaxy hops impart a tropical citrus aroma that gives way to a bright, juicy citrus hop flavor but without the hop bitterness. The brewers have been experimenting for over a year, tested over 60 iterations with multiple combinations of 12 different hop varieties in the nano brewery in Boston in order to perfect the Sam '76 recipe.
