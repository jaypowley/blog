### About The Hop Concept

> Our Hop Freshener series simplifies your choice of which beer to enjoy right now. Just read the name and you’ll know exactly what to expect. After all, those dank and piney notes you enjoy so much? That’s really just your nose doing its job, and proof you should trust your senses. Each season, we release a limited edition using different aromatic and flavorful hop combinations to bring out a specific character. Four IPAs, each available just once a year, and all crafted by The Hop Concept, the same team of lifelong brewers behind Port Brewing Company. It’s that simple. Honest, hoppy beers, from the people who know how to make them. So slow down, inhale, and drink fresh.
