### About 180 Shilling Ale

> In 1989 we opened our doors with our flagship, 90 Shilling. Still a favorite today, we’re celebrating our Silver Anniversary with a double version of the recipe that started it all. We’re a little bigger now, and 180 Shilling is too, with a hearty roasted malt base balanced by subtle earthy hops and aged on oak to create notes of toffee, plum, vanilla and dried cherry. Thanks for 25 years of beers, and here’s to many more. Cheers!
