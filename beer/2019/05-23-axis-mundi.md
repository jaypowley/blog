### About Axis Mundi

> The Siberians believed there was a "World Tree" that served as the Axis Mundi, connecting the different worlds through its roots and branches. While this Russian Imperial Stout isn't necessarily the world's cosmic axis, it does connect rich flavors in a way to deliver you a cosmic beer.
