### About Neon Nights

> A New England-Style Double IPA brewed and double dry-hopped with fruit forward hops. This beer boasts bold flavors of passion fruit and mango, alongside a creamy mouthfeel and velvety finish. Smooth and surprisingly easy-drinking, with big tropical flavor and a hint of finishing bitter.
