### About Barrel-aged Giant Made of Shadows (2018)

> A special blend of differing barrels present a new & unique presentation of the classic Belgian-Style Strong Ale. Cognac barrels impart a jammy and vanilla-like character, while Bourbon barrels provide a back-end of caramel & tobacco-like flavors.
