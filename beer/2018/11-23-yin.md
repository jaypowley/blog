## Yin by Evil Twin Brewing

I tried to make a black and tan with Yin and Yang...fail. ðŸ˜‚

### About Yin

> This is one half of a Black & Tan. Not just any Black & Tan, but one where a toasted smug and hoppy fella get together to make a sublime Taiji balance. Mix the Yin & Yang together (or enjoy this profoundly evil Imperial Stout solo).
