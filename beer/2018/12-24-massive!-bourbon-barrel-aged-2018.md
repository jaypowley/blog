### About MASSIVE! (Bourbon Barrel Aged) (2018)

> Description: In making MASSIVE! Bourbon Barrel Aged we used only British Golden Promise malt and boiled for eight hours, giving the beer a deep ruby color and rich malt flavor. We then aged MASSIVE! in bourbon barrels for almost 2 years. Enjoy the richness and intensity now, or after years and year and years more of aging.
>
>Tasting Notes: Richness abounds with aromas and flavors of caramel, coconut, maple, dark fruits, citrus, rose, toffee and bourbon.
