### About Obbie's Grand Cru

> Obbie’s Grand Cru is the first in a series of Belgian style beers to come from the Gettysburg ABC. This Belgian Strong Golden Ale combines a slight spiciness with a complex maltiness. The bittering is evident and balanced against a pleasant fruity character. Although the abv. (7.2%) is somewhat elevated, this beer is very nice and effervescent on a nice summer day.
>
>Obbie is the brain child of one of our great Mug Club Members - Scott Balthasar. If you wish, you may visit Scott’s website and purchase apparel featuring Obbie, or as he is better known... St. Obnoxious!
