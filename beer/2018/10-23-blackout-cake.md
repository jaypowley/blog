### About Blackout Cake

> A massive and dense pastry stout brewed with our good friend Jordan from Late Start Brewing out of Tampa Florida. Brewed from a ridiculously staggering amount of specialty malts, fresh vanilla, fudgy coffee from our dudes at Little Amps! and boatloads of cacao nibs. Notes of rich, double chocolate cake with hints of roasted barley and coffee peaking through a smooth vanilla veil. LIVE FAST, DIE....abetes.
