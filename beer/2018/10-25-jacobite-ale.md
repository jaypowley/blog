### About Jacobite Ale

> Traquair Jacobite Ale is a Scotch ale with an ancient ingredient, coriander: rich, deep flavors are accented by exotic coriander aroma. Traquair House Brewery, located within Scotland's oldest inhabited house, uses a 1738 copper kettle and oak fermenters to produce this fine ale, first brewed in 1995 to commemorate the Jacobite Revolution.
