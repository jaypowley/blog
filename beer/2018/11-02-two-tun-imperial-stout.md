### About Two Tun Imperial Stout

> Our Imperial Stout pours out black with a thick brown colored head. The aroma is a mixture of cocoa, black coffee, roasted malts and a hint of molasses. Its flavor is a decadent balance of black coffee, bittersweet dark chocolate, roasted malts, a touch of molasses and a soft fruit character. A moderately full bodied beer with matching carbonation, this imperial stout has just enough alcohol to keep your cheeks warm, and a dry finish to keep you coming back for more.
