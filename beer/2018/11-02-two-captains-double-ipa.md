### About Two Captains Double IPA

> Jan Halvor Fjeld, winner of Norwegian homebrewing championship 2010 brewed his champion double IPA at Nøgne Ø. We at Nøgne Ø are of course proud to be with him in making this happen.
>
> This double IPA is truly American inspired. It is fairly dry, which allows the hops to dominate. There is bitterness up front, some balanced malts in the middle and complex fruity and resiny hop aromas which simply has no end.
