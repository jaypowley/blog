### About Carnal Knowledge In the Morn

> Double oatmeal stout aged in bourbon barrels with coffee vanilla and cocoa nibs. In the morning, don't say you love me...serve me up with the richness of chelate and Carmel malts blended with coffee, cocoa and notes of vanilla and bourbon stained wood. Won't need too much persuading.
