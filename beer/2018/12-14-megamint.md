### About MegaMint

> Big & Bold with a touch of Mint. This Imperial Chocolate Milk Stout is kicked up a notch by using fresh picked mint in the brewing process. The milk sugar leaves a pleasant residual sweetness that is balanced with the chocolate & biscuit notes of the specialty malt that are seductively balanced with aroma of the cacao nibs and fresh mint. Look out Keebler we got a thin mint beer!
