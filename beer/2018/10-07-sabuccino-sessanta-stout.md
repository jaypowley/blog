## Sabuccino Sessanta Stout by Pizza By Brewing

![beer-pic]

> Amore a prima vista! This decadent coffee and vanilla Imperial sweet stout was brewed for our good friends 
at Sabatini’s in Exeter, PA for their 60th anniversary. For this one we took enormous, like ENORMOUS, 
amounts of malt including pale ale, roasted barley, chocolate malt, 3 types of crystal and combined them 
with nearly 4 pounds of fresh Madagascar Vanilla beans and almost 2.5 pounds of coffee per barrel to make 
what we think is a perfectly over the top cappuccino stout. Our friends at Little Amps Coffee Roasters 
whipped us up the best beans for the brew, as always. Happy Anniversary Sabs, here’s to 60 more! Notes 
of heart stopping richness, heart racing coffee, lush vanilla and an excess of bunga bunga.
