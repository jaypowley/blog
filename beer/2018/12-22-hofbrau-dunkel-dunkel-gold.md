> Dark beer existed in Bavaria long before light beer. This was the first type of beer to be brewed at Hofbrauhaus when it was founded. Today, when beer-lovers all over the world talk about dark beer, they usually mean a Munich style beer. Today, Hofbrau Dunkel - the archetypal Bavarian beer - is still as popular as ever. With its alcoholic content of around 5.5% volume and its spicy taste, it's a refreshing beer that suits all kinds of occasions. A beer in the traditional Munich style!
