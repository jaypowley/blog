### About Golden Thing

> Hunting the fields during hop harvest, we were stopped in our tracks by the otherworldly lemon notes of a hop called Lemondrop. We just had to build a beer around it. Our HopCyclone circulates Lemondropâ€™s citrusy oils throughout Golden Thing, and dry-hopping with Lemondrop and Centennial leads to juicy layers of fresh lemonade, pinesap, and sweet citrus.
