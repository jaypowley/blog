### About Yeti Chai

> Our beloved Yeti is going back to its roots with this Himalayan-inspired variation. Traditional Chai spices of cinnamon, green cardamom, black pepper, ginger, nutmeg, and vanilla blend seamlessly with Yetiâ€™s rich, roasted malt backbone for a spicy beast fit to tackle Everest.
