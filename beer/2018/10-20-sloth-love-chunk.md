### About Four Fathers Brewing

> As if you needed any more reasons to make a pit stop on the way to or from Chicago, Four Fathers Brewing opened its doors in 2014 in Valparaiso. Their brewery anchors a small industrial building along humble two-lane Lincolnway Road. As relatively fresh faces to the Northwest Indiana beer scene, this husband and wife duo have aimed to make 'Valpo' part of the craft beer sandwich between Chicago and Indiana. Brewers Jason Lacny and Elizabeth Lacny, have set out to create a community taproom full of uniquely brewed pints.
