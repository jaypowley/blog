### About Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star

> Imperial Oatmeal Stout Aged in Bourbon Barrels
This year’s release is a blend of 24, 18, 12, and 8-month Bourbon Barrel-Aged Dark Star in 7-12-year old Kentucky bourbon barrels. The roasted and chocolate malts complement the smooth oats to bring you a stout delight wrapped in the gentle embrace of bourbon barrel-aged warmth. A touch of sweetness dances in balance with the hops to finish with a wave, and then she’s gone.
>
>2-Row Pale, Roast Barley, Crystal-60, Chocolate, and Carafa-2 malts with Flaked Oats and Columbus, Willamette, and Cascade hops.
