### About Schwandtoberfest

> What the hosen is Schwandtoberfest?! In a word: magical. This Bavarian style festbier is a true family tradition featuring rich, toasty malt balanced by a crisp hop bitterness and floral hop aroma of tangerine and orange blossom. This beer is the only excuse you need to don your finest pair of lederhosen.
