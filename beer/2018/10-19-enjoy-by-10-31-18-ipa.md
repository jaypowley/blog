### About Enjoy By 10.31.18 IPA

> While freshness is a key component of many beers—especially big, citrusy, floral IPAs—we’ve taken it further, a lot further, in this line of devastatingly fresh IPAs. You see, not only did we brew this beer with over 10 different hops, we’ve also gone to extensive lengths to ensure that you’re getting this double IPA in your hands within an extraordinarily short window. That’s why the Enjoy By date isn’t randomly etched in tiny text somewhere on the bottle, to be overlooked by all but the most attentive. Instead, we’ve sent a clear message in the name of the beer itself—further proving that there is no better time than right NOW to enjoy this IPA.

> We didn’t stop there with this paradigm-shifting beer either…we introduced Stone Enjoy By Black IPA and unique spinoff versions of Stone Enjoy By IPA to make one devastatingly exciting series.
