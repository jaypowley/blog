### About Farmette

> A spell on oak with our house culture - a wayward mix of microflora we've been cultivating since our very first foray into wild fermentation - transformed this saison into something altogether unexpected. The wood tempers the traditional notes of clove and pepper, making way for layers of woodsy earthiness and lemon tang.
