### About Fremont Brewing

> Fremont Brewing was born of our love for our home and history as well as the desire to prove that beer made with the finest local ingredients â€“ organic when possible --, is not the wave of the future but the doorway to beer's history. Starting a brewery in the midst of the Great Recession is clearly an act of passion. We invite you to come along with us and enjoy that passion -- because beer matters.
