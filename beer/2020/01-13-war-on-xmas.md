### About War On Xmas

> A thick, milky-white stout with rich, textured body accented by Indonesian vanilla beans, Vietnamese cassia bark cinnamon & nutmeg all provided by our good friends at Epic Spices in Chicago. The result is a surprisingly balanced spiced beer reminiscent of delicious, mind-bending egg nog and holiday cookies of years gone by.
