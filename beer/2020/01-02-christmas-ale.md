### About Christmas Ale

> This specialty beer is characterized by its deep dark colour, with a creamy, thick head and a full, almost velvety taste with a fruity nose. Brewed annually for the holiday season, the long winter nights are perfect moments to savour this ale with or without friends and to enjoy its unique, complex taste.
