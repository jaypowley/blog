### About Embers Remain

> This imperial stout is an exercise in the scorched earth policy, in other words, don't drink this first. Big body, warming alcohol and a roast intensity to balance the beer out and prevent it from being overly sweet. Through amplified old world stout techniques and ingredients this beer employs the gratuitous use of brown and black malts to make a flavorful and intensely dark experience. This stout is like the event horizon of a blackhole, it is the point of no return.
