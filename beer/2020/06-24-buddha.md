### About Buddha

> Bright Crisp with a hint of citrus on the nose. This gives way to subtle but present hops on the mid palate. The balance of the beer shows itself off with the finish. It has a lingering fresh fresh citrus with just a touch of bitterness that brings you right back to another sip!!
