### About Therapy Sessions [Cinnamon + Pecan + Coconut] (Ghost 795)

> Each hurried breath crystallizes upon contact with the brisk evening air. A chill creeps down the spine quickening your pulse - hastening your fear. Maniacal laughter echoes through the halls as you descend into the belly of the fun house. Backed against a mirror, unable to scream, a shadowy figure makes itself visible. Surrounded by your greatest fear... Eyes snap shut as you beg to wake up from this dream. Suddenly, his fangs sink deep into your skin and your fear becomes reality.
