### About Capitulation

> What do you do when customers say "I love hoppy beers"? Well, if you're any other brewery you might brew 6 different IPA's for them to choose from, but if you're Monkless, you capitulate, and dry hop your classic Belgian Tripel. We took one of our favorite beers, The Trinity, and dry hopped it to add a blast of flowery, citrusy hop aroma.
