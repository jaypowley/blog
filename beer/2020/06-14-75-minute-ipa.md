### About 75 Minute IPA

> It's been a minute â€¦ but 75 Minute IPA is back! What began as a cask-conditioned ale at our Rehoboth brewpub back in 2011, quickly grew to become a cult-favorite amongst craft enthusiasts. From the groucho glasses that adorned the label to it's slightly dry and lingering bitterness, 75 Minute was (and is) beloved by many.
>
> Now in our latest iteration, this classic IPA is again brewed with maple syrup from Sam's family farm in Massachusetts, while being continually hopped throughout the boil, and then dry-hopped with a slew of cascade hops. The result is a malty and earthy brew with citrusy-pine aromas, balanced by subtle maple notes.
