### About Saxy Machismo

> Put on your fireproof pants, folks—this one’s got muscle. A slightly smoky, raisin-sweet Belgian-style Quad infused with guajillo and fire-roasted fresh habanero chili peppers, then aged in Four Roses bourbon whiskey barrels for 9 months before being blended to a perfect balance of sweet and heat.
