### About Trappistes Rochefort 8

> Originally called "Spécial," Rochefort 8 dates to the mid-1950s. The name comes from the original gravity in "Belgian degrees."
>
> Deep brown color; the flavor is vigorous and complex, with firm body to support the strength. The aroma has elusive notes of fresh fruit, spice, leather, and figs. 
>
> ABV 9.2 IBU 22
