### About Trignac XII (2017)

> The Trignac is a unique degustation beer, truly one of a kind. It's a Kasteel Triple matured in barrels previously used for Cognac. There is no escaping the sweet aroma of grapes and the impact of alcohol, giving a slight impression of wine on the nose. This returns in a taste that leans towards cognac. The alcohol fully fills the mouth and gives a delightfully warm feeling that resonate for quite some time.
