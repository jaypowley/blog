### About Mississippi Mud Stout

> Inspired by the sweet Southern sensation, we present our Mississippi Mud Pie Stout. This imperial stout evokes fudgy brownie crust, whipped marshmallow and a sprinkle of nutty pecans. The roast of the brewsâ€™ base lends some balance to its decadent richness paired with its mouthfeel that finishes creamy, yet airy like the pie itself. We invite you to indulge in Southern hospitality and share with your friends.
