### About Blood Orange Cranberry Tart Ale

> The classic Madras cocktail was our inspiration for this beer. Lactobacillus fermentation lays down a tart canvas, then a second fermentation with our house ale yeast makes way for the sweet citrus of fresh blood orange and the tangy bite of cranberries. Coriander adds a floral undertone, while a touch of salt helps to amplify the fruit notes and tame the sweetness.
