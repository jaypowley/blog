## New Keyboard

![new-keyboard]

So a lot of my coworkers have these mechanical keyboards with varying level of "clackiness". I love the look and tactal feel of a mechancal keyboard, but I am not one to spend a pretty penny on these one off/custom keyboards that they buy. They all fan boy over the cherry mx (insert color of choice here) switches and the distinct sound and feel and kg of pressure to actuate, blah, blah, blah. I want the feel without the noise. So when I heard that there was now a "silent" switch I was immediately intrigued.

Welcome the Corsair STRAFE RGB MK.2 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard with CHERRY MX Silent key switches. I've set the color to a constant purple to match [my company's](https://www.leidos.com/company) color scheme.
