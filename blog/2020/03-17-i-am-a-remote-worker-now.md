## I Am A Remote Worker Now

It's official, I am a remote worker.

I'm not going to lie, it's a strange feeling. It will definitely take some getting used to.

I mean, I've worked from home before. I was just never fully productive, and was home because I had to attend to some other facet of life like a sick kid, or traveling wife, or expecting a package that required a signature. It's not that those things distracted me, but I'm just more productive at the office. I like the office. That's where I go to do work. When I'm there I don't really think of home or get distracted by outside world things. And when I'm at home, I don't ever think of work. I like to keep the two seperate and distinguished.

Well, we'll see how it goes.

Stay safe!
